## Inspiration
Seeking help is often the first step towards getting and staying well, but it can be hard to know how to start or where to turn to. It's common to feel unsure, and to wonder whether you should try to handle things on your own. But it's always ok to ask for help â€“ even if you're not sure you are experiencing a specific mental health problem. This website HealingHub is built for people to fight their mental illness by talking to a therapist and seeking help. HealingHub also provides blog section to help the users to share about various facts and techniques to heal themselves.

## What it does
The website HealingHub allows patients of mental health and therapists to register themselves. It allows patients to have a one to one conversation with the Trained therapists and counsellors of his/her choice. Talking about your feelings can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled. HealingHub also allows users to post a blog relating to mental health, their way of dealing with it to inspire others, or on various facts and meditation techniques.

## How we built it
Tech Stack used : PHP, MySQL, Apache.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully integrated the chat and blog backend with the frontend. The real time chat is the most important aspect of HealingHub. The patients on HealingHub can talk to therapists on a real time basis as and when they require.

## What we learned
We learned to build a realtime chat app and integrated it with our project. We also gained a lot of knowledge about mental health.

## What's next for Healing Hub
HealingHub is fully fledged and can be hosted for use in real world.
